In this machine learning project, I have collected the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) and I will be using Machine Learning to predict whether any person is suffering from heart disease.

1. I have uploaded my dataset into my jupiter notebook.
2. Then i started with data exploration in this i checked for any missing values in the datasets.
3. Feature Engineering:> Then i have analysed data for correlation between features and label.
4. Then i have plot some histograms for better analysis.
5. Data processing:> Finally i have converted all categorical features with the help of one hot encoding.
6. Then i splitted my train-test data.
7. With the help of KNN Classifier i developed my model.

Tools used in this project is:
1. Jupiter Notebook as IDE
2. Pandas and Numpy.
3. Seaborn for visualization
4. Sklearn
